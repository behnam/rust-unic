# Steps

- cargo update --verbose

# First test all components and stop if anything goes wrong
for component in $COMPONENTS; do
    - cargo test    --verbose --manifest-path components/$component/Cargo.toml
done

# Then publish all components, and ignore failures (usually because of the version being released already)
for component in $COMPONENTS; do
    - cargo publish --verbose --manifest-path components/$component/Cargo.toml || true
done

- cargo publish --verbose
